=======
### Development Environment
The app is written fully in Kotlin and uses the Gradle build system.

To build the app, use the gradlew build command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio. A canary or stable version >= 3.4 of Android Studio is required and may be downloaded [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive).

### Architecture

Proposed Architecture:

We will be using libraries, modules and dynamic feature modules too.

### Architecture Introduction
We took a modularisation approach to develop the application. There are immense benefits that come about with modularising an application; faster builds due to gradle caching and parallelism, benefit of dynamic features which can be delivered on demand therefore reducing initial apk size, clear separation of concerns and ease of maintaining and adding new features. An application can be modularised either by feature or by layer, we decided to take a hybrid approach that combines both approaches. 

**Data Module**

The data module provides support for data persistence and offline caching. It consists of room database, entities and daos. We opted for a single database source of truth as opposed to having multiple databases for each feature. At the point of developing this application, Room did not support multi-database queries and thus having a single database will save us time trying to combine data from multiple databases. In addition to this, a single database helps us avoid duplication of data and tests. The data module exposes itself to the repository layer via a datasource interface to prevent the repository from knowing the implementation details of the data layer thus observing the dependency rule. This will also enhance the flexibility of the application as we can easily switch from Room to SQLite or Realm if need be. This module consists of a mapper to convert entities to data classes that can be passed around.

**Network Module**

The network module provides support for making network requests to external APIs. This module basically consists of retrofit interfaces, response data classes and mappers to convert the response classes. The network module is exposed to the repository layer via a remote datasource. 

**Repository module**

The repository module depends on the data module and the network module. The role of this module is to sync data from different sources and present it as a single source. Ideally, the repository module observes the repository pattern recommended by Google.

**Features**

The application contains three features i.e. schedule, feed & about and one dynamic feature i.e tickets. The features depend on the repository module and the core module. The dynamic feature depends on the app module.

**App**

The app module handles navigation between the features. It also consists of key UI activities or fragments. e.g. Login. 

**Base Core**

Consists of classes and logic that is to be shared across the application. It contains utility classes and functions as well. The base core is a library.

</p>

#### Modules To Be There:
With the above in mind, here are the actual modules in the droidconKE2020 app following the guidelines laid above
1. app
2. core (library)
3. data (library)
4. features - directory for grouping all the feature modules together. It has the following dynamic feature modules:

    - about - has the details of the event,  team members and their details that is when each team member card is clicked
    - auth - has the sign-up, sign-in, forgot password and reset password logic
    - feed - has a #droidconKE newsfeed
    - feedback - has session and event feedback logic
    - home - shows sponsors, promoted stuff, organizers and changes according to time ie before and during the event
    - sessions - shows each days sessions(day one, day two, day three) session details, and also has filter sessions logic and show a user's favorited sessions
    - speaker  - shows speaker details
 5. repository(library)
 6. network(library)
 
#### Koin Integration & Guides
Dependency injection is integrated into the project based on the
project's architecture. Each modules gradle file has koin dependencies.

**Data module**

The data module define a databaseModule in Module.kt file. The module
defines a room database like:

    `single {
        Room.databaseBuilder(
                androidApplication(),
                DroidConDB::class.java,
                "droidCon.db")
            .build()
    }`

Then define entity in its on directory. Each entity defines a Data
Access Object interfaces and data sources. For example, the user
directory includes; user model file, UserDao interface and a
LocalUserDataSource file. To define dependencies follow these steps;

Define a data access object like this;

    `@Dao
    interface UserDao {
        @Query("SELECT * FROM user")
        fun getUser(): User
    }`

Then define a koin dependency like this:

    `factory { get<DroidConDB>().userDao() }`

and a data source dependencies like this:

    `factory { LocalUserDataSource(get()) }`

**Network Module**

The network module also defines individual entities which shall contain
response and request bodies (DTOs), if they are necessary, api service
interface and a data source.

To inject dependencies for data sources, do this:

    `factory { get<Retrofit>().create(UserAPIService::class.java) }`

for api service interface dependency injection definition add this:

    `factory { RemoteUserDataSource(get()) }`

to define data source dependencies.

**Repository Module**

The repository is dependent on the network and data module. To define a
repository dependency, do this:

    `factory { UserRepository(get(), get()) }`

The first parameter is the UserLocalDataSource from the data module and
the second is the UserRemoteDataSource from the network module.

**Features**

Each feature depend on the repository module. ViewModel dependencies
require repository dependencies. for viewmodel injection, follow this
steps;

create a class, for example LoginViewModel,

    `class AuthViewModel(private val repository: UserRepository): ViewModel() {
        fun login(username: String, password: String) {
            repository.login(username, password) }  
    }`

Then in the features di directory, add a viewmodel injection like this:

    `viewModel { AuthViewModel(get()) }`

then inject the viewmodel into a fragment/activity

    `class AuthFragment: Fragment() {
        **val authFragment: AuthFragment by viewModel()**
        
        override fun onCreateView(
            inflater: LayoutInflater,
            container: ViewGroup?,
            savedInstanceState: Bundle?
        ): View? {
            return super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState)
        }    
    }`

#### Gradle
 The App uses Kotlin DSL for its gradle due to the obvious advantages Kotlin affords as compared to Groovy. 
 The Dependencies.kt file under buildSrc is where we store all our App Dependencies and contains the following objects;
 1.	Versions; 
     The versions object contains all the Application’s version code and version name as well as all the variable library version codes. 
 2.	BuildPlugins;
     This object contains all the plugins required for the build process.
 3.	Libraries;
     This object contains all the required imported application libraries.
 4.	APIs
     This object contains all the required APIs
 5.	AndroidSDK
     This object contains the minSDK, targetSDK and compileSDK version codes
 6.	TestLibraries
     This object contains all the required Libraries for testing.
 7.	BuildModules 
     This object is split into Libraries and Features. The Libraries contain the APP module and the other core Modules which are to be reused in different Dynamic features while the Features contain specific functionality of different aspects of the app.
 
 To add a Dependency go to the Dependencies.kt file add it in the required object. Then go to the target build.gradle.kts file and add the code. E.g.;
  	Implementation(ObjectName.Example)


 #### Navigation
 The app uses Single Activity Architecture. And follows [Navigation Principles](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-principles) from Jetpack. And since features are all dynamic modules, we have taken advantage of the introduction of the support of dynamic features in the navigation component in the latest [release](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/navigation#2.3.0-alpha01). How this works is we use fragments in the feature modules and add the fragments to the main nav graph which has the support for adding destinations from dynamic feature modules. More on this is in the [Navigate with dynamic feature modules
](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-dynamic) tutorial. Note: Adding destinations might not work in AS version below 3.6 Release Candidate 3(RC3) and destination fragment name might be in red but no worries, app runs well as expected.

    or JUST,

- [Fork the project and send a pull request](https://github.com/droidconKE/droidconKE2020App/pulls).


## Coding Convention

- For any view id, ie. Buttons, Edit Texts etc., we will use camelCase ie. btnLogin, etName.

- Classes name end with the name of the component e.g. MainActivity and MainViewModel

- For layout xml files the name of the component comes first i.e. fragment_login

- The parent layout container id is given a prefix layout_ e.g. layout_login

- Value files should always be in plural ie. strings/colors/styles etc.

- String values should be named as txt_login or err_failed and should not be in block and colors values should be in small ie. colorBlue

- Recycler view layouts should start with the prefix item eg. item_sessions

and xml attributes ie. background should be named as btn_login_bg.xml

- Menu items should be named as activity_main it is repetitive to add the term menu since they are contained in the menu directory

- Ideally, in the xml, the first attribute after the tag is id, then width, then height and then anything else android: followed by app and lastly tools:
